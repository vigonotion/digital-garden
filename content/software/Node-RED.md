From their [website](https://nodered.org/):

> Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
> 
> It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

I use Node-RED in combination with [[Home Assistant]] for complex automations, and [[Home Assistant]] directly for simpler automations.
