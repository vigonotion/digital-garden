Welcome to my digital garden where I mostly write about smart home.

## Dive in

For short thoughts I had, check out the [[notes/index|notes]] and make sure to use the search if you know what you are looking for.

## Featured projects

On [GitHub](https://github.com/vigonotion), you can find my own open source projects, like these:

- [pygti](https://github.com/vigonotion/pygti): A python library to access public transportation data like travel times from the [hvv](https://hvv.de/) in Hamburg
- [stadtreinigung_hamburg](https://github.com/vigonotion/stadtreinigung_hamburg): Another python library to access waste collection dates from the cleansing department in Hamburg.

Those two are actually the building blocks for an [official integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hvv_departures/) and a [custom component](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.stadtreinigung_hamburg) for [[Home Assistant]].
